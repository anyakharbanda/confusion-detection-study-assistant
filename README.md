#  Confusion Detection Study Assistant
This project combines OCR, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI-based NLP to create an interactive, real-time study assistant. It not only detects confusion dynamically but also provides AI-generated explanations, improving user engagement and making self-learning more effective.

📖 Problem Statement
Many students struggle to comprehend complex study materials, often getting confused while reading lengthy or technical content. Traditional learning tools provide text summaries but do not dynamically detect confusion in real time.
This project solves the problem by:
✅ Detecting real-time confusion using eye tracking and facial expressions.
✅ Extracting text from PDFs and images using OCR.
✅ Applying AI-based NLP (via Google Gemini API) to provide simplified explanations.
✅ Using deep learning models to improve confusion detection.
